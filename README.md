NFLPicks
========

A very simple web app allowing a group of people to manage and compare their NFL picks throughout the season.

This is primarily a proof of concept project to discover best practices for using Git in connection with other established development tools that are known to me. The primary goal is to develop a LAMP server side product using Eclipse for the PHP layer and MySQL Workbench for the DB layer in order to learn about their integation with Git.
